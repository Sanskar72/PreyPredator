# Probabilistic ML
<br>The purpose of this project is to build a probabilistic model of an environment in the presence of uncertainty, and use it to inform and direct decision making. <br>
An agent is pursuing a prey object, while simultaneously being pursued by a predator object, and want to capture the target and evade capture itselg.<br>
This will be complicated by not necessarily being able to see where the predator and prey are - but making must use of the information the agent has to make the most informed decisions it can about what to do.<br>
<hr>
The environment for this project is a graph of nodes connected by edges. <br>
The agent, the prey, and the predator,can move between the nodes along the edges. <br>
There are 50 nodes, numbered 1 to 50, connected in a large circle. Additionally, add edges at random to increase connectivity across the circle.<br>
